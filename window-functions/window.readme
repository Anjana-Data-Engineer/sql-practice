Window Functions in SQL

SQL window functions allow performing calculations across a set of rows that are related to the current row, without collapsing the result into a single value.
They are commonly used for tasks like aggregates, rankings and running totals.

The OVER clause defines the “window” of rows for the calculation. It can:

PARTITION BY: divide the data into groups.
ORDER BY: specify the order of rows within each group.
Unlike an aggregate function, a window function does not group rows into one single row.
