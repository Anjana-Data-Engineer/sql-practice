# SQL Practice Repository

This repository contains my SQL practice as part of my journey toward a Python/Data role in Europe (with focus on Denmark).  
I use this space to document SQL concepts, practice exercises, and solutions from platforms like SQLBolt, SQLZoo, HackerRank, and custom datasets.
