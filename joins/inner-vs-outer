When to Use SQL INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN
INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN also differ in their practical use cases in data retrieval.

When to use INNER JOIN
INNER JOIN is most effective when you need only the intersecting data from two tables.
For example, you may use INNER JOIN when analyzing sales data to find products that have been sold, such as when both product and sales tables have matching entries.

When to use OUTER JOIN
OUTER JOIN is appropriate when you need to return a complete dataset, including unmatched rows. For example,
when generating a report to show all employees, including those without a department assignment, or all departments, including those without employees.
